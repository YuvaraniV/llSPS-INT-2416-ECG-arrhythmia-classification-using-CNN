# ECG arrhythmia classification using CNN

<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death today.
Over 17.7 million people died from CVDs in the year 2017 all over the world
which is about 31% of all deaths, and over 75% of these deaths occur in low
and middle income countries. Arrhythmia is a representative type of CVD
that refers to any irregular change from the normal heart rhythms. There
are several types of arrhythmia including atrial fibrillation, premature
contraction, ventricular fibrillation, and tachycardia. Although single
arrhythmia heartbeat may not have a serious impact on life, continuous
arrhythmia beats can result in fatal circumstances. For example, prolonged
premature ventricular contraction (PVCs) beats occasionally turn into a
ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) beats which can
immediately lead to heart failure. Thus, it is important to periodically
monitor the heart rhythms to manage and prevent the CVDs.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive medical tool that displays the
rhythm and status of the heart. Therefore, automatic detection of irregular
heart rhythms from ECG signals is a significant task in the field of
cardiology.
